# Twix

This project illustrates features of Phoenix/LiveView that include

  * LiveView form editing with validation
  * PubSub subscriptions
  * Broadcasting events and viewing updates reactively in real-time 
  * Progressive scrolling of large data sets

The project shows the power of Phoenix/LiveView development that allows
to implement sophisticated logic rapidly using a single language without
needing to add any Javascript.

It is a more advanced version of Chris McCord's post
